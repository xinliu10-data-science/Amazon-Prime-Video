# Predictive Analytics of Amazon Prime Movies

When a user opens the homepage for Amazon Prime Video, he/she will probably end up seeing a page that looks like this. But have you ever wondered, what are the most important characteristics of a movie that make people spend more time on it? Is it the genre? Is it the language of the movie? Or even the position of the movie on the webpage?

There is no easy answer for this question. In this project, we will build a prediction model to predict whether a movie is going to perform well (measured by cumulative time viewed by audiences per day) on the Amazon Prime Video platform. The analysis is based on a dataset with 4000+ rows and 16 columns.
